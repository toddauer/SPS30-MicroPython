# SPS30-MicroPython

This repository contains code for interfacing with the SPS30 particulate matter sensor using MicroPython. The code allows you to read air quality measurements such as PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10.0, and particle counts in various size ranges. It also includes functionality to start/stop measurements, read the firmware version, and activate cleaning mode.

Features:
Start and stop measurements.

Read PM concentrations (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10.0).

Read particle count data for various sizes (NC0.5, NC1.0, NC2.5, NC4.0, NC10.0).

Firmware version reading.

Enter and complete cleaning mode.

Read and print raw sensor data in a human-readable format.
